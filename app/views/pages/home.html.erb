  The Corona lockdown counteracted the spring workshop for the Amsterdam Ruby community.
  Instead, we turned the workshop into a full featured online course. And to be honest: we think
  it's even better than the workshop :-) Collateral gains.

      Maud about DJ: "I always wondered why DJ loved JavaScript so much. I know he loved Ruby, and I didn't understand how one can love Ruby and JavaScript at the same time.
      When I showed him a piece of my JavaScript in Rails code, and we started refactoring together, I finally started to see
      what JavaScript <em>could</em> be - but almost never is. I admire his ability to play with the differences between the languages. And it's good fun to work with him."
